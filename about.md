# Welcome!

Hi! This is my Hastebin page I used to paste code. 

## Basic Usage

Type what you want me to see, click "Save", and then copy the URL.  Send that
URL to someone and they'll see what you see.

To make a new entry, click "New" (or type 'control + n')

## Open Source

Haste can easily be installed behind your network, and it's all open source!
